## What is a Hashtag Token (HASHTAG)?

Hashtag Tokens are digital representations of hashtag text strings stored as
non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Hashtag Protocol uses the [Ethereum ERC-721
specification](https://erc721.org/) for Hashtag Tokens. This specification has
a few properties that makes it both ideally suited for and perhaps
revolutionary to the use of hashtags. First, as opposed to the more common
ERC-20 specification that supports a predetermined (and potentially unlimited)
number of interchangeable digital tokens, each ERC-721 token is completely
unique; there is and always be only one copy. Because of this, ERC-721 NFTs
are ideally suited to represent or contain one-of-a-kind items of value;
artworks, gaming skins, movie tickets, domain names, real estate titles. In
the case of the Hashtag Protocol, each Hashtag Token both contains and
represents a unique hashtag string. Second, as digital assets, Hashtag Tokens
can be created, bought and traded by anyone with an Ethereum compatible
wallet.
