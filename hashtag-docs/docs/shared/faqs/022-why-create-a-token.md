## Why would I want to create a HASHTAG?

For the same reason people create and use hashtags on centralized platforms: to
promote and increase engagement in your content by making it more easily
discoverable both within and between decentralized web applications. Another
use case is organizing content under one or more tags (aka. social
bookmarking).

Additionally, you may want to speculate on the future value/use cases for
hashtag strings tokenized as NFTs on a public blockchain.
