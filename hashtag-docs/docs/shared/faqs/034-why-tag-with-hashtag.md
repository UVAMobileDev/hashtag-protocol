## Why should I tag content with a HASHTAG?

For the same reason people use hashtags on centralized platforms: to promote
and increase engagement in your content by making it more easily discoverable
both within and between decentralized web applications.

Beyond that, your tagging data is saved to a decentralized, un-censorable
global database.

In Phase 4 we hope to develop financial incentive mechanisms for **_Taggers_**.
