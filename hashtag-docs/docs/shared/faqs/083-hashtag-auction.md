## What is the Hashtag Auction?

To ensure fair and intelligent valuation and distribution of HASHTAG tokens, all
newly created tokens will be sold via public auction. There will be a“First
Public Auction” of tokens created during Phase 1 & 2 and an ongoing public
auction for tokens created and released after the First Public Auction (Phase3)
has commenced.

See [Hashtag Token
Auction](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/protocol-overview.html#hashtag-token-auction)
for more details.
