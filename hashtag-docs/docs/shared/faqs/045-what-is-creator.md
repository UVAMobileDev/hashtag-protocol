## What is a "Creator"?

A **_Creator_** is the user or entity, represented by a Ethereum wallet address,
that brings the HASHTAG token into existence by executing the HASHTAG token
minting contract. 

This can be a user of a **_Publisher_** platform or the **_Publisher_** itself. 

The **_Creator_** wallet address is logged in the token and will receive revenue
from the Protocol should the token used for tagging prior to auction and/or should
the token be purchased at auction. See [revenue
sharing](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/protocol-overview.html#revenue-sharing).
