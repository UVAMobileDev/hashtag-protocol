## Is there any limit to what I can tag?

There is no limit to the number of items you may tag, however the Protocol only
supports tagging other ERC-721 NFTs. We plan to develop tagging contracts for
other on-chain digital asset and content types. For more details on that, see
[our roadmap](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/roadmap.html).
