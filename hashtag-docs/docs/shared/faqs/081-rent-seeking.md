## Isnâ€™t Hashtag Protocol just rent seeking?

Quite the opposite. We envision a paradigm shift where hashtags are mediated by
a decentralized crypto-economic network rather than a few central authorities.

The result will be a global information architecture that is more freely and
efficiently accessed than today and an unlocking of value presently siloed,
obscured and monopolized in a few centralized social networks.
