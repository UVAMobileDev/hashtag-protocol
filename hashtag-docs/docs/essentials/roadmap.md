# Project Roadmap

Our roadmap aims to address the challenges of bootstrapping our game-theory
incentive mechanisms to a sufficient degree that the self-interest of
participants creates a positive feedback loop leading to positive network
growth and tangible benefits to society. 

Our incentive mechanisms involve at least [six key
participants](/essentials/participants) each with different user stories
and use cases. Having participants to interact in a fully operational manner
from at launch is not possible: as such it will be choreographed in the
following phases:


## Phase 1: Mainnet launch with MVP


1. Release a minimum viable product (MVP) on the Ethereum mainnet that
   solves the simplest of use cases: enabling NFT artists and owners to tag
   NFTs with hashtag tokens. This functionality will be provided within the
   [demonstration application](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org) published by
   the Protocol.

## Phase 2: Platform promotion

1. Seed the network with real Hashtag Tokens and tagging real assets with
   them.
2. Recruit NFT artists, owners and influencers to mint HASHTAG and
   tag NFT assets with them.
3. Recruit potential **_publishers_** to experiment with and/or implement the
   protocol.
4. Promote the Protocol to all appropriate social channels.
5. Improve & expand documentation.
6. Recruit [Hashtag Protocol Council](/essentials/hashtag-council).
7. Develop the Hashtag Auction functionality and UI.

## Phase 3: Launch public HASHTAG auction

1. Launch the [Public Hashtag Token Auction](/essentials/#hashtag-auction).
2. Continue to develop auction so third parties may run auctions (ie. Become
   “auctioneers”).

## Phase 4: Tagger incentivization and data quality mechanisms

1. Develop mechanisms that will financially incentivize taggers.
2. Develop mechanisms to incentivize keepers of data quality (“Curators”).
3. Hashtag localization & translation services.
