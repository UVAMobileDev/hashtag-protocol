# Project Roadmap

Our roadmap aims to address the challenges of bootstrapping our
incentive mechanisms to a sufficient degree that the self-interest of
participants creates a feedback loop leading to network growth
and positive benefits to society.

Our incentive mechanisms involve at least [six key
participants](/essentials/participants) each with very different roles. Having
participants interact in a fully operational manner from at launch is not
possible: as such it will be choreographed in the following phases:


## Phase 1: Mainnet launch with MVP


1. Release a minimum viable product (MVP) on the Ethereum mainnet that solves
   the simplest of use cases: enabling NFT artists and owners to tag NFTs with
   hashtag tokens. This functionality will be provided within the [demonstration
   application](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org) published by the Protocol.
   This will make Hashtag the first **_Publisher_**.

## Phase 2: Platform promotion

1. Seed the network with real `HASHTAG` tokens and tagging real assets with them.
2. Recruit NFT artists, owners and influencers to mint `HASHTAG` and tag NFT
   assets with them.
3. Recruit potential **_Publishers_** to experiment with and/or implement the
   protocol.
4. Promote the Protocol to all appropriate social channels.
5. Improve & expand documentation.
6. Recruit [Hashtag Protocol Council](/essentials/hashtag-council).
7. Develop the Hashtag Auction functionality and UI.
8. Recruit **_Auctioneers_**

## Phase 3: Commence HASHTAG auction

1. Launch the [Public Hashtag Token Auction](/essentials/protocol-overview.html#hashtag-token-auction).
2. Continued Hashtag Protocol promotion.

## Phase 4: Tagger incentivization and data quality mechanisms

1. Develop mechanisms that will financially incentivize **_Taggers_**.
2. Develop mechanisms to incentivize keepers of data quality (**_Curators_**).
3. Hashtag localization & translation services.
