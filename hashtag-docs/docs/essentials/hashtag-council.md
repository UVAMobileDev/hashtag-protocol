# Hashtag Protocol Council

A panel of stakeholders and advisors drawn from influential NFT and blockchain
projects to help guide Hashtag Protocol in fulfilling our mission. 

Council members will be chosen during [Phase
2](/essentials/roadmap.html#phase-2-platform-promotion) of the project and will be
publicly announced once five members are identified.
