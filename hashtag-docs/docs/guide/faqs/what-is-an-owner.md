## What's an "Owner"?

An “Owner” is an Ethereum address that owns one or more Hashtag Tokens. An “Owner” can come to “own” a Hashtag Token by either creating one on a participating Publisher platform, or by purchasing one on a secondary market such as OpenSea.io. As soon as a Hashtag Token is created, the “Creator” becomes de facto “Owner”. The successful purchaser of a Hashtag Token on the secondary market becomes the new “Owner” of that Hashtag Token, and assumes certain benefits that include but are not limited to:

- Sole ownership of a unique Hashtag Token containing and representing a unique hashtag string.
- Dividends received from The Protocol when a Tagger tags content with their hashtag.
- Ability to re-sell their token either peer-to-peer or on a standard NFT marketplace such as Opensea.
