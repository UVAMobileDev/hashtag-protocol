### What is a "Publisher"?

A Publisher is an application, network or platform implementing the Hashtag Protocol to provide their customers and/or application content tagging stored to a decentralized, globally readable database.

At the present time, Publishers must be white-listed to use The Protocol. If you'd like to whitelist your application, please register your application.
