## What is a "Publisher"?

A Publisher is an application, network or platform implementing the Hashtag
Protocol to provide their customers and/or application content tagging stored
to a decentralized, globally readable database.

As Protocol revenues are shared with Publishers, they must be white-listed to
use the Protocol. If you'd like to whitelist your application, please contact
us to be added to the Protocol.
