## What is "tagged content"?

In addition to creating non-fungible crytographic tokens (NFTs) that both
contain and represent hashtag strings, Hashtag Protocol provides a facility
for linking them to any online digital artifact, effectively "tagging" that
content with the hashtag string. This is facilitated by linking smart contracts
that support a many-to-many token-to-content relationship. For example, one
Hashtag Token can be used to tag many pieces of content and one price of
content can be tagged with many hashtags. Presently, only linking to other
ERC-721 NFTs is supported. The Protocol can be extended to tag other digital
assets.
