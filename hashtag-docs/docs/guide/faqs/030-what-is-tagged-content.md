## What is "tagged content"?

In addition to creating crytographic tokens that both contain and represent
hashtag strings, Hashtag Protocol provides a facility for linking them to any
online digital artifact, effectively "tagging" that content with the hashtag.
This is facilitated by "linking smart contracts" that support a many-to-many
token-to-content relationship. For example, one Hashtag Token can be used to
tag many pieces of content and one price of content can be tagged with many
hashtags. Presently, only linking to other ERC-721 NFTs is supported. The
Protocol can be extended to tag other digital assets.
