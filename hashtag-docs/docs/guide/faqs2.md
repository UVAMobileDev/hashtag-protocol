## What is Hashtag Protocol?

## What is a Hashtag Token?
Hashtag Tokens are digital representations of hashtag text strings stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The Hashtag Protocol uses the [Ethereum ERC-721 specification](http://erc721.org/) for Hashtag Tokens. This specification has a few properties that makes it both ideally suited for and perhaps revolutionary to the use of hashtags. First, as opposed to the more common ERC-20 specification in which many, identical copies of a digital token exist, each ERC-721 token is completely unique; there is and always be only one copy. Because of this, ERC-721 tokens are ideally suited to represent or contain one-of-a-kind items of value; artworks, gaming skins, movie tickets, domain names, real estate titles. In the case of the Hashtag Protocol, each Hashtag Token both contains and represents a unique hashtag string. Second, as digital assets, Hashtag Tokens can be created, bought and sold by anyone.
