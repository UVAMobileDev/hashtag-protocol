# Introduction

People use hashtags to increase discoverability and engagement of online
content. This utility gives hashtags immense social, functional and monetary
value. While taggers derive some benefit, we believe the lion's share of this
value is monopolized and hoarded by centralized social networks.

**We envision a world where hashtags are decentralized**

To achieve our vision, we have developed an experimental protocol consisting
of a set of Ethereum smart contracts that enables the tokenization of hashtag
strings into ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs); the “tagging” of other
digital assets with those tokens; and APIs for surfacing this data for use in
networks, platforms and applications.

Stitched into the Protocol are game-theory incentive mechanisms that harnesses
the self-interest of participants to drive positive network growth.
