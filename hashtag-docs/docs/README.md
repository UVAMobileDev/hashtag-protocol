# Introduction

People around the globe use hashtags to increase discoverability and
engagement of online content. One estimate from 2017 is that on Twitter alone
around 125 million hashtags are shared every day. This widespread use gives
hashtags undeniably immense social, functional and monetary value. And while
taggers certainly derive some value from tagging content, we believe the
lion's share of the value is siloed and monopolized by a few centralized
social networks.

The result will be a global information architecture that is more efficient
and freely accessible than today with potential use cases that can only be
described as revolutionary.

To achieve our vision, we have developed an experimental protocol consisting
of a set of Ethereum smart contracts that enables the tokenization of hashtag
strings into ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs); the “tagging” of other
digital assets with those tokens; and APIs for surfacing this data for use in
networks, platforms and applications.

Stitched into the Protocol are game-theory incentive mechanisms that harnesses
the self-interest of participants to drive positive network growth.
